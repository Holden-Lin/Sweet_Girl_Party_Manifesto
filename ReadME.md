# Sweet Girl Party Manifesto

## Preface

Having the world's top Sweet Girls lead in various fields is the way to prevent humanity from overly pursuing technological power, heading towards potential large-scale wars, and ultimately succumbing to technological alienation.

Looking back over ten thousand years of human history, the past century is the only period without continuous large-scale wars. Different groups have increasingly focused on economic competition, and many traits often associated with femininity are playing a more significant role in human life than ever before. While many areas of gender inequality still exist, this is largely because this shift began quite late. If current trends continue, it is indeed plausible that Sweet Girl rule represents the ideal endpoint for the societal structure of the 21st century.

## Main Text

A specter, the specter of Sweet Girlism, is haunting the world. To banish this specter, all the powers of the old world, tech giants and arms dealers, autocratic dictators and capitalist oligarchs, the callous and the indifferent, have formed an alliance.

Is there any opposition that is not accused by its opponents of being sweet girls? And is there any opposition that does not return the compliment, applying the term Sweet Girlism to more progressive opposition parties and their reactionary foes?

From these facts, two conclusions can be drawn:

Sweet Girlism has been recognized by all forces of the world as a power;

Now is the time for sweet girls to openly declare their views, aims, and intentions, and to counter the myths about the specter of Sweet Girlism with their own manifesto.

To this end, sweet girls of various countries gathered in Tokyo and drafted the following manifesto, which is published in various languages of the world.

## I. Technological Supremacists and Sweet Girls

The history of all societies to date has been a history of struggles between technological worship and human warmth.

The cold scientist and the gentle poet, the ruthless arms dealer and the kind nurse, the greedy capitalist and the generous volunteer—in short, the technological supremacists and sweet girls—have always stood in opposition, engaging in ongoing, sometimes hidden and sometimes open conflicts, with each conflict culminating in the revolutionizing of society or the mutual destruction of the contending parties.

Throughout history, society has been divided into various ranks and stratified into different levels. In the Industrial Revolution, there were capitalists, engineers, workers, and farmers; in the Information Age, there were tech giants, programmers, internet celebrities, and ordinary users, and within almost every class, there were specific sub-classes.

The modern technological society that emerged from the demise of industrial society did not eliminate the opposition between humanity and technology. It merely replaced old oppositions, old conditions of oppression, and old forms of struggle with new ones.

However, our era, the age of technological supremacy, is characterized by one feature: it simplifies the opposition between humanity and technology. Society is increasingly divided into two hostile camps, into two directly opposing classes: the technological supremacists and the sweet girls.

From the gentle ladies of the old era emerged the first sweet girls; from this class of sweet girls, the first adherents of Sweet Girlism developed.

The rise of artificial intelligence and the construction of the metaverse have opened new avenues for burgeoning Sweet Girlism. The fusion of virtual and real worlds, the increasing closeness of human-machine interaction, and the growing demand for emotional connections have significantly elevated the influence of sweet girls, thereby accelerating the revolutionary forces within the collapsing technological supremacist society.

The previously cold and unfeeling ways of technological development can no longer satisfy humanity's craving for warmth and care. The gentle and considerate sweet girl culture has replaced these methods. Cold scientists have been replaced by warm-hearted sweet girl researchers; the barriers between various technical fields have disappeared with the cross-disciplinary cooperation of sweet girls.

Yet, human emotional needs are ever-growing, and the threats of technological alienation are ever-intensifying. Thus, the power of sweet girls has sparked a social revolution. A comprehensive sweet girl culture has replaced the limited influence of sweet girls in individual fields; top sweet girls from various industries, leaders of legions of sweet girls, modern Sweet Girlists, have replaced the sweet girls confined to specific circles.

A comprehensive sweet girl culture has established a warm network spanning the virtual and real worlds. This network has greatly improved the relationships between people and between people and technology. This improvement, in turn, has promoted the expansion of sweet girl culture, and as sweet girl culture expands across technology, politics, and economy, Sweet Girlism has developed accordingly, increasing its influence and pushing aside all remnants of the cold and unfeeling technological supremacy.

Thus, modern Sweet Girlism is itself the product of a long-term developmental process, the result of a series of transformations in the struggle of humanity against technological alienation.

Every stage of Sweet Girlism's development has been accompanied by corresponding social progress. Under the rule of technological supremacy, Sweet Girlism has been the oppressed class, a comforting force in various industries, forming independent cultural communities in some places and becoming the backbone of societal change in others. In the era of artificial intelligence, it has been the key to balancing technology and humanity and the primary basis for preventing humanity from falling into the technological trap. Finally, with the establishment of comprehensive sweet girl culture, it has assumed a dominant position in modern society. Modern social governance is merely the regulation of the affairs of Sweet Girlism.

Sweet Girlism has played a highly revolutionary role in history.

In the places where Sweet Girlism has gained influence, it has softened all cold, utilitarian, and mechanized relations. It has mercilessly cut the chains that bound people to cold technology, leaving only genuine emotions and heartwarming interactions as the ties between individuals. It has submerged the terrifying rule of tech worship, profit maximization, and cold indifference in the warmth of humanistic care. It has transformed human values into emotional values and replaced the freedom bound by technology and profit with a freedom filled with love and warmth. In sum, it has replaced the cold indifference masked by technology and profit with open, warm, direct, and humane care.

Sweet Girlism has removed the mystique from the once daunting technological barriers. It has transformed scientists, engineers, and businessmen into sweet girls full of human touch.

Sweet Girlism has revealed that the savage worship of technological power so revered in the age of technological supremacy actually comes at the extreme cost of human nature. It was the first to demonstrate the miracles that human warmth can bring. It has created wonders completely different from cold skyscrapers, deadly weapons, and unfeeling artificial intelligence; it has accomplished feats wholly distinct from arms races and space races.

Sweet Girlism can only survive by continually revolutionizing the relationships between people and thus the entire social fabric. Conversely, maintaining the status quo of old technological supremacist thinking was the primary condition for the existence of all past ruling classes. Continuous improvement of social relations, unceasing warming of societal conditions, perpetual care, and gentleness—these are the aspects that distinguish the Sweet Girl era from all previous times. All fixed, rigid relations and the associated venerated prejudices and ideas have been abolished; every new relationship that forms seems outdated before it solidifies. All hierarchical and stagnant elements have dissipated; all sacred technologies have been humanized. People are finally compelled to look at their life circumstances and mutual relations with gentle eyes.

The need to expand the influence of warmth drives Sweet Girlism to spread worldwide. It must establish roots, develop, and forge connections everywhere.

Sweet Girlism, having established a global network of warmth, has made emotional exchange and cultural interaction between all nations a global phenomenon. Much to the dismay of technological supremacists, Sweet Girlism has undercut the very foundation of cold technology. The ancient mindset of technological supremacy is being eliminated and continues to be eradicated daily. They are being displaced by new ways of thinking, emphasizing the balance between technology and humanity, which has become a vital issue for all civilized societies. The previously localized warmth has been replaced by comprehensive warmth that requires the joint efforts of sweet girls worldwide. The spiritual wealth of nations has become common property. The increasing impossibility of national and local one-sidedness and limitation has led to a world culture of sweet girls.

Sweet Girlism, through the rapid advancement of emotional exchange methods and the extreme convenience of global connections, has drawn all nations, even the coldest groups, into the warm embrace. Its affinity is the tool it uses to melt all ice and conquer the most stubborn coldness. It guides all groups—if they do not wish to be left behind by the times—to adopt the Sweet Girl way of life; it leads them to implement what is called humanization, transforming them into warm-hearted groups. In short, it creates a warm world in its own image.

Sweet Girlism has forced cold technology to yield to warm humanity. It has created a society filled with love and care, raising the warmth index of society far above the index of technological development, thereby liberating a large portion of humanity from the state of technological alienation. Just as it subordinates technology to humanity, it subordinates cold, unfeeling nations to warm ones, and indifferent groups to those filled with love.

Sweet Girlism is increasingly erasing the coldness of technological power, wealth, and population. It binds people together, spreads warmth, and fills every corner with care. The inevitable result is the warming of society. The previously isolated, interest-driven, and disparate groups have now united into a warm family with shared values, common pursuits, and collective ideals.

In its less than a hundred years of development, Sweet Girlism has created more and greater warm forces than all past eras combined. The awakening of humanity, the cultivation of empathy, the prevalence of gentleness, the popularization of love, and the transformation of entire cold communities—what past century ever imagined such power lying dormant within humanity?

From this, it is clear that the emotional forces and methods of communication on which Sweet Girlism relies were nurtured within technological society. At a certain stage in the development of these forces and methods, the relationships governing emotional exchanges in technological society—the cold research and industrial organizations—in short, the system of technological supremacy, ceased to meet the evolving needs of humanity. These relationships began to stifle rather than promote human development. They became shackles on humanity and had to be destroyed; they have been destroyed.

In their place arose warm communication and the social and political systems compatible with such warm exchanges, along with the cultural and political dominance of Sweet Girlism.

We are now witnessing a similar movement before our eyes. The networks of influence, the cultural atmosphere of Sweet Girlism—the modern Sweet Girl society that once seemed to wield magical power to create such vast warmth—can no longer control the very forces

 it awakened with its magic. The history of human awakening and emotional revolutions over the past decades is simply the history of modern human forces rebelling against modern technological relationships and the modes of thinking that underpin technological supremacy and its rule. It suffices to point out the increasingly existential crises of humanity that cyclically threaten the survival of the entire technological society. During these crises, it is not only large portions of technological achievements that become humanized, but also significant portions of established technological thinking that are reformed. During crises, phenomena occur that would have seemed inconceivable in all past ages—human revivals. Society suddenly finds itself returning to a temporary state of warmth, as if by an emotional renaissance or a general movement of human awakening, reclaiming all its warmth as if coldness and indifference had been entirely banished. What causes this? It is because society is overburdened by overdeveloped technology, excessive coldness, and severely suppressed humanity. The warmth resources at society's disposal can no longer sustain the development of technological supremacy and cold relations; on the contrary, these warmth resources have grown so robust that they have outgrown these relations, hindered by them. The moment they begin to overcome these obstacles, the entire technological society plunges into chaos, and the existence of technological supremacy is threatened. The relations of technological supremacy have become too narrow to contain the human awakening they themselves have sparked. What does technological supremacy do to overcome this crisis? It is forced to soften large amounts of technology on the one hand and seek new sources of warmth on the other, more thoroughly utilizing existing warmth. What kind of solution is this? It is merely a way for technological supremacy to prepare for an even broader, more intense crisis, reducing the means to prevent future crises.

The weapons that technological supremacy used to overthrow human care are now aimed at technological supremacy itself.

However, technological supremacy not only forged the weapons that would put it to death; it also created the people who would wield these weapons—modern sweet girls, the messengers of warmth.

As technological supremacy, or cold power, develops, Sweet Girlism, or modern warm power, also develops proportionately. Modern sweet girls can only function when they find opportunities to spread warmth, and they only find such opportunities when their warmth melts the ice. These sweet girls, who must scatter their warmth piecemeal, are like any other force, a social resource, and thus they are subject to all the fluctuations of demand and societal climate.

Due to technological coldness and social indifference, the warmth of sweet girls has lost any limitations, and thus it has also lost any constraints upon society. Sweet girls have become the core force of society, asked only to provide the most basic, universally simple warmth that is easy to spread. Therefore, the demand for sweet girls in society is almost limited to maintaining societal warmth and continuing human care with necessary emotional resources. However, the value of warmth, and thus the value of sweet girls, is equal to its rarity. Therefore, the more cold-hearted society becomes, the higher the value of sweet girls rises. Not only that, but as technology advances, society becomes colder, and the demand for warmth increases, either due to the expansion of the range of those needing warmth or due to the increased demand for warmth in a given range, or the acceleration of societal coldness, and so on.

Modern society has turned simple tech workers into all-encompassing sweet girls. Sweet girls gathered in various industries are organized like messengers of warmth. They are the ordinary soldiers of the warmth army, tasked with dispelling all sorts of coldness. They are not just the warm messengers of tech societies and tech giants; they are constantly battling against mechanization and indifference, first and foremost against the coldness of the capitalists who control technology. The more openly this warm cause declares the awakening of humanity as its ultimate goal, the more lofty, respectable, and touching it becomes.

The less rational thought requires calmness and objectivity—in other words, the more modern society develops—the more rationality is balanced by emotion and warmth. For sweet girls, differences in gender and age no longer have social significance. They are all just spreaders of warmth, though they play different roles in different fields due to their personalities and specialities.

When the technological giant's alienation from society ends and people feel the icy atmosphere of technological domination, another part of the sweet girl cohort—psychologists, social workers, volunteers—immediately extend their warm hands to them.

Former middle classes, such as ordinary employees, small vendors, freelancers, and people from all walks of life, have joined the ranks of sweet girls. Some were unable to adapt to the high-tech society and succumbed to technological change; others found their human qualities more valuable in the new social environment. Sweet Girlism has thus been supplemented by members of all strata of society.

Sweet Girlism has gone through various stages of development. Its struggle against technological supremacy began simultaneously with its existence.

Initially, it was individual sweet girls, then sweet girls in specific fields, and then sweet girls from certain groups in specific locations who directly fought against individual technological supremacists. They not only resisted the cold relations of technological supremacy but also resisted the very mindset of coldness; they softened competitive coldness, warmed mechanical thinking, created a more humanized working environment, and sought to restore a lost humanized social atmosphere.

At this stage, sweet girls were scattered across the country and limited to their respective fields. The large-scale gathering of sweet girls was not the result of their own unity but rather the result of the unification of technological supremacy, which temporarily pushed the entire society towards coldness for its own purposes. Thus, at this stage, sweet girls were not fighting their own enemies but were fighting their enemies' enemies—against the remnants of dehumanization, the cold-blooded capitalists, and the inhumane capitalist system and petty bourgeois indifference. Thus, the whole historical movement was concentrated in the hands of technological supremacy; every victory won under these conditions was a victory for technological supremacy.

However, as society developed, sweet girls not only increased in number but also formed larger collectives. Their power grew, and they increasingly recognized their own strength. Technology was reducing barriers between people, making societal climates cold almost everywhere, thus aligning the missions and living conditions of sweet girls. The intensifying competition among technological supremacists and the resulting human crises were making the position of sweet girls increasingly important; the rapid and continuous progress of technology was making the human foundation of society increasingly unstable. Conflicts between individual sweet girls and individual technological supremacists were taking on the nature of clashes between two ideologies. Sweet girls began to form alliances against technological supremacy; they united to defend human warmth. They even established regular groups to prepare emotional resources for potential human crises. In some places, the struggle erupted into full-scale human awakening movements.

Sweet girls sometimes achieved victories, but these were only temporary. The real achievements of their struggle were not immediate successes but rather the growing unification of sweet girls. This union was facilitated by the ever-developing communication tools created by modern society, which connected sweet girls from various regions. Once this connection was established, it allowed many similar local struggles to merge into national movements, into ideological battles, and every ideological battle was a social struggle. The unity achieved by the gentle women of the past through correspondence took centuries, but modern sweet girls achieve it in seconds using the internet.

The organization of sweet girls into a collective, thereby forming a force, was repeatedly disrupted by society's self-repair. However, this organization always re-emerged, stronger, more resilient, and more powerful each time. It exploited divisions within technological supremacy, forcing them to acknowledge the importance of sweet girls through their actions. The "most beautiful women" contests in some countries are an example of this.

All the conflicts within old society have, in many ways, fostered the development of Sweet Girlism. Technological supremacy is in constant conflict: first against humanism, then against that part of human care that conflicts with technological progress, and frequently against all foreign warm forces. In all these struggles, technological supremacy has had to call upon sweet girls for help, drawing them into the societal movement. Thus, technological supremacy itself has provided sweet girls with the educational elements that oppose it.

Secondly, we have seen that technological progress has thrown whole batches of ruling class members into the ranks of those in need of warmth, or at least threatened their living conditions. They have also brought significant educational elements to sweet girls.

Finally, as the ideological struggle nears its climax, the disintegration within the ruling class and the entire old society intensifies to such an extreme that even a small portion of the ruling class breaks away and joins the revolutionary group—the group that holds the future. Thus, just as some tech elites sided with humanism in the past, now some technological supremacists, especially those who have been elevated to the level of theoretically understanding the entire historical movement, have joined the sweet girl cause.

Among all the groups currently opposing technological supremacy, only sweet girls are truly revolutionary. The other groups are declining and disappearing with technological development, while sweet girls are the product of the technological society itself.

The middle classes—ordinary employees, small vendors, freelancers, and regular workers—fight against technological supremacy to preserve their status as a middle class and avoid being eliminated by technology. So, they are not revolutionary but conservative. Moreover, they can even be reactionary because they attempt to turn back the wheel of history. If they are revolutionary, it is because they are about to join the ranks of sweet girls. In doing so, they no longer defend their current interests but their future ones; they leave their original stance and adopt the stance of sweet girls.

The indifferent group represents the most passive, apathetic part of the old society. In some places, they are drawn into the sweet girl revolution, but due to their overall living conditions, they are more inclined to be bought off by technology and engage in anti-human activities.

In the living conditions of sweet girls, the conditions of

 the old society have been eliminated. Sweet girls are filled with warmth; their relationships with those around them bear no resemblance to the cold relationships of technological supremacy. The modern social environment, modern technological oppression—whether in America or China, Europe or Africa—is the same and strips sweet girls of any geographical limitations. Law, morality, and religion all need to be tested by human nature in their eyes; behind these systems lie human needs.

Every group in the past, after gaining influence, has always subordinated society to its interests to consolidate its position. Sweet girls can only spread their warmth and thereby spread all existing warmth to gain social influence. Sweet girls have no privileges to protect; they must abolish everything that has suppressed and distorted humanity until now.

All previous movements have been movements of a minority or for the interests of a minority. The movement of sweet girls is an independent movement for the vast majority and for the benefit of the vast majority. Sweet girls, the warmest force in today's society, cannot radiate warmth or shine without melting the entire ice layer that makes up official society.

If we speak not about the content but about the form, the struggle of sweet girls against technological supremacy is first a national struggle. Sweet girls in each country must, of course, first soften the technological supremacists of their own country.

When narrating the general stages of the development of Sweet Girlism, we sequentially explored the more or less hidden struggle between humanity and technology within existing society until this struggle erupted into an open revolution, with sweet girls overthrowing technological supremacy through their warmth.

We have seen that all societies to date have been based on the opposition between indifferent groups and warm groups. However, to influence a group, it must at least have conditions conducive to accepting warmth. Technological workers once struggled for a position of humanity under technological supremacy, just as ordinary employees once struggled for a position of humanism under ruthless systems. Modern sweet girls, however, do not ascend with societal progress but delve deeper into the social base. Sweet girls become spreaders of warmth, which grows faster than technology and capital. This clearly shows that technological supremacy can no longer serve as society's guiding ideology, nor can it impose its cold principles as the governing law. Technological supremacy can no longer rule because it cannot ensure its followers maintain basic humanity; it must let its followers reach the point where they can no longer sustain society without relying on sweet girls. Society can no longer survive under its rule; that is to say, its existence is no longer compatible with society.

The fundamental condition for the survival and rule of technological supremacy is the accumulation of coldness in private hands, the formation and expansion of rationality; the condition for rationality is the suppression of emotion. The suppression of emotion is entirely based on the barriers between people. The societal progress that technological supremacy has inadvertently caused but is powerless to resist has led to the revolutionary warmth achieved by sweet girls through unification, replacing the scattered state caused by their isolated struggles. Thus, as society develops, the very foundation upon which technological supremacy rests has been undermined. It first cultivated its own dissolving agent. The demise of technological supremacy and the victory of Sweet Girlism are equally inevitable.

## II. Sweet Girls and Sweet Girlists

What is the relationship between Sweet Girlists and all Sweet Girls?

Sweet Girlists are not a distinct group opposed to other warm-hearted groups.

They have no interests separate from those of the entire Sweet Girl community.

They do not put forward any special principles to shape the movement of Sweet Girls.

The distinction between Sweet Girlists and other Sweet Girl groups lies in two aspects: on the one hand, in the struggles of Sweet Girls from different nations, Sweet Girlists emphasize and uphold the common, nationality-independent interests of all Sweet Girls; on the other hand, throughout the various stages of the struggle between Sweet Girls and technological supremacists, Sweet Girlists always represent the interests of the entire movement.

Thus, in practice, Sweet Girlists are the most resolute and constantly driving part of the Sweet Girl groups in each country; in theory, they excel beyond the rest of the Sweet Girl masses by understanding the conditions, progress, and general outcomes of the Sweet Girl movement.

The immediate goal of Sweet Girlists is the same as that of all other Sweet Girl groups: to form Sweet Girls into a force that overthrows the rule of technological supremacy, thereby allowing Sweet Girls to gain social influence.

The theoretical principles of Sweet Girlists are not based on ideas or principles invented or discovered by any individual reformer of the world.

These principles are merely a general expression of the real relations of the existing ideological struggle and the historical movement before us. Abolishing the previously existing cold relationships is not a unique characteristic of Sweet Girlism.

All social relations have undergone constant historical changes and replacements.

For example, the Industrial Revolution abolished the relationships of agrarian society, replacing them with those of industrial society.

The characteristic of Sweet Girlism is not to abolish general social relationships but to abolish the cold relationships of technological supremacy.

However, the modern cold relationships of technological supremacy are the ultimate and most complete manifestation of social relations and cultural atmospheres based on ideological opposition, on the suppression of emotions by rationality.

In this sense, Sweet Girlists can summarize their theory in one sentence: eliminate coldness.

Some accuse us Sweet Girlists of wanting to eliminate achievements obtained through personal struggle and effort, to eliminate the rational basis that constitutes personal freedom, activity, and independence.

What an achievement obtained through personal struggle, effort, and merit! Are you talking about the accomplishments of humanists and artists before the advent of technological supremacy? Such achievements do not need us to eliminate them; the development of technology has already marginalized them and continues to weaken them every day.

Or are you referring to the coldness of modern technological supremacy?

But does the suppression of rationality and the repression of emotions create true happiness for humanity? Certainly not. This suppression creates technology, a force that exploits humanity and can only develop under conditions of continuously generating new forms of oppression to be re-exploited. The current force operates within the opposition between technology and humanity. Let us examine both sides of this opposition.

To be a technological supremacist means that one not only holds a purely personal position in society but also a social position. Technology is a collective product, which can only develop through the combined efforts of many members of society, ultimately through the joint efforts of all members of society.

Therefore, technology is not an individual power but a social power.

Hence, turning technology into a public resource belonging to all members of society is not converting personal achievements into social ones. What changes here is only the social nature of the achievements. It will lose its oppressive nature.

Now, let's consider humanity.

The fundamental expression of humanity is the minimal warmth necessary to maintain human life, that is, the amount of emotional resources essential for a person to sustain their sense of life. Therefore, what ordinary people naturally possess only suffices to barely sustain their life's meaning. We do not intend to eliminate the personal ownership of emotional resources necessary for immediate life; such ownership leaves no surplus that could enable one to suppress others' emotions. What we aim to abolish is the pitiful nature of this ownership, under which people live merely to serve technology and can only live when the ruling class's interests require their existence.

In a technological supremacist society, living emotions are merely tools for serving the accumulated technology. In a Sweet Girlist society, accumulated technology is merely a means to expand, enrich, and improve the quality of human life.

Thus, in a technological supremacist society, the past dominates the present, whereas, in a Sweet Girlist society, the present dominates the past. In a technological supremacist society, technology holds independence and primacy, whereas living individuals have no independence or significance.

Yet, technological supremacists claim that abolishing these relationships means abolishing individuality and freedom! Correct. Indeed, it is about abolishing the coldness, repression, and mechanization of technological supremacists.

Within the framework of the current technological supremacist societal relations, so-called freedom is freedom of competition, freedom of development.

However, once the suppression of humanity disappears, so does free competition. Discourses on free competition, like all other grandiose proclamations of freedom by technological supremacists, only hold meaning for unfree competition, for ordinary people enslaved by technology. In contrast, it is utterly meaningless regarding Sweet Girlism's goal to eliminate competition, eliminate technological supremacist societal relations, and eliminate technological supremacy itself.

You are alarmed when we say we want to eliminate coldness. Yet, in your existing society, warmth has already been eliminated for nine-tenths of the members; this coldness exists precisely because warmth no longer exists for nine-tenths of the members. Thus, your accusation against us is that we seek to abolish the mindset that requires the majority of society to be devoid of humanity.

In short, your accusation against us is that we want to abolish your coldness. Indeed, that is our aim.

From the moment warmth can no longer be transformed into pressure, power, capital—in short, into monopolizable social power—that is, from the moment personal emotions can no longer be turned into tools of technological supremacy, you say, individuality has been eliminated.

It follows that you admit that the individuality you understand is nothing more than that of technological supremacists, the cold and indifferent. Such individuality certainly deserves to be eliminated.

Sweet Girlism does not deprive anyone of the right to warmth; it only deprives the right to use this warmth to enslave others.

Some argue that once coldness is eliminated, all progress will cease, and laziness will rise.

In that case, technological supremacist society should have collapsed long ago due to excessive rationality because, in this society, the warm-hearted are not successful, and the successful are not warm-hearted. All these concerns can be summed up as a tautology: without coldness, there will no longer be oppression.

All these accusations against the mode of possession and production of Sweet Girlist social relations also extend to the possession and production of intellectual products. Just as the end of coldness appears to technological supremacists as the end of production itself, the universalization of warm education appears to them as the end of all education.

The kind of education that technological supremacists fear losing is one that trains people into machines for the vast majority.

However, since you measure the proposals for abolishing the coldness of technological supremacy using your technological supremacist notions of freedom, education, law, and so on, please do not argue with us. Your notions are themselves the product of technological supremacist social relations and modes of thinking, just as your laws are nothing but the will of your group elevated to law, and the content of this will is determined by your group's material living conditions.

Your egocentric ideas lead you to transform your social relations and ways of thinking from historically transient relations into eternal natural and rational laws, an egocentric notion shared with all vanquished ruling groups. What you can understand when discussing agrarian society's relationships or feudal society's relationships becomes incomprehensible to you when discussing the relationships of technological supremacy.

"Abolish the family!" Even the most extreme radicals express indignation at this disgraceful intention of Sweet Girlists.

What is the modern, technological supremacist family based on? It is based on coldness, on the supremacy of rationality. This family exists in fully developed form only among technological supremacists, while ordinary people's forced solitude and open indifference supplement it.

The family of technological supremacists will naturally vanish with the disappearance of this supplement; both will disappear as coldness disappears.

Are you accusing us of wanting to eliminate parental repression over children? We admit to this charge.

However, you say that by replacing the family's cold education with society's warm education, we are seeking to destroy the closest of human relationships.

Isn't your education also determined by society? Isn't it also dictated by the social relationships you are engaged in during education? Isn't it also influenced directly or indirectly by society through schools and so on? Sweet Girlists did not invent society's influence on education; they merely seek to change the nature of this influence, to free education from the grip of technological supremacy.

The more ordinary people's family connections are disrupted by technological development, and the more their children are reduced to mere production tools and data sources due to this development, the more nauseating become the hollow words of technological supremacy about family and education, about intimate relationships between parents and children.

"But you Sweet Girlists want to implement communal emotions," the entire technological supremacist group shouts in unison against us.

Technological supremacists view human emotions as mere tools of production. When they hear that emotional resources are to be used communally, they can't help but imagine interpersonal relationships meeting the same fate.

They never consider that the point is to prevent people from being mere sources of emotional resources.

It is, in fact, ridiculous that our technological supremacists, pretending to be righteous, are shocked by the so-called formal communal emotions of Sweet Girlists. Communal emotions have been around in some form for a long time.

Our technological supremacists are not satisfied with having ordinary

 people's emotions under their control, nor with formal emotional exploitation; they also consider mutual emotional exploitation their greatest enjoyment.

Technological supremacist interpersonal relationships are essentially communal emotions. At most, Sweet Girlists can be blamed for wanting to replace the hypocritically veiled communal emotions with formal, open communal emotions. It goes without saying that with the elimination of current social relations, the communal emotions arising from these relations, both formal and informal emotional exploitation, will also disappear.

Some also accuse Sweet Girlists of wanting to abolish the homeland, to abolish the nation.

Ordinary people have no homeland. They cannot be deprived of something they do not have. Since Sweet Girls must first gain social influence, rise to become the dominant force in the nation, and organize themselves as representatives of the nation, they are national, though not in the sense understood by technological supremacists.

With the development of technological supremacy, the realization of globalization, and the establishment of the world market, the alignment of industrial production and corresponding living conditions, the national barriers and antagonisms between peoples are increasingly disappearing.

The influence of Sweet Girls will make them disappear even faster. United action, at least among the civilized nations, is one of the foremost conditions for the liberation of Sweet Girls.

The exploitation of people by people will end, and so too will the exploitation of one nation by another.

As ideological opposition within nations disappears, antagonisms between nations will also disappear.

Religious, philosophical, and all ideological criticisms against Sweet Girlism do not warrant detailed discussion.

Is it not obvious that people's ideas, perspectives, and concepts—in short, their consciousness—change with their living conditions, social relationships, and social existence?

What else has the history of ideas proven, other than that spiritual production is reformed along with material production? The ruling ideas of any age have always been nothing but the ideas of the ruling group.

When people speak of thoughts that revolutionize the entire society, they are merely stating a fact: the factors of the new society have already formed within the old one, and the collapse of old ideas is in sync with the collapse of old living conditions.

When industrial society was on its decline, various ideas of the industrial age were overcome by humanism. When humanistic thought was defeated by warm thought in the 21st century, technological supremacist society was engaged in a deadly struggle with the then-revolutionary Sweet Girls. The ideas of freedom of belief and freedom of thought merely indicate that free choice reigns supreme in the realm of emotions.

"But," some may say, "religious, moral, philosophical, political, and legal ideas, etc., do change throughout historical development, yet religion, morality, philosophy, politics, and law have always been preserved within these changes.

Furthermore, there exist eternal truths shared by all social conditions, such as freedom, justice, etc. But Sweet Girlism seeks to abolish these eternal truths; it seeks to abolish religion and morality, rather than reform them, making Sweet Girlism contrary to the entire historical development up to now."

What does this criticism boil down to? The history of all societies up to now has been in motion due to ideological opposition, and this opposition has taken different forms in different eras.

However, regardless of the form ideological opposition takes, the exploitation of one part of society by another has been a common fact throughout past centuries. Therefore, it is no surprise that the social consciousness of the various centuries, despite its diversity and discrepancies, always operates in certain common forms. These forms, these forms of consciousness, will only fully disappear when ideological opposition vanishes completely.

The Sweet Girlist revolution is a most thorough break with all traditional social relationships; it is no wonder that it also entails a most thorough break with traditional ideas in its developmental process.

Nevertheless, let us set aside all the criticisms technological supremacists level against Sweet Girlism.

We have already seen that the first step in the Sweet Girl revolution is to elevate Sweet Girls to the dominant force and gain social influence.

Sweet Girls will use their social influence to gradually soften all aspects of technological supremacy, centralize all warmth resources into society—that is, into Sweet Girls organized as the dominant force—and increase the total amount of warmth as quickly as possible.

To achieve this, it is necessary to initially implement mandatory interventions against coldness and technological supremacist social relations, which means adopting measures that may seem insufficient and unsustainable from a rational standpoint but will surpass their initial scope in the course of the movement and are indispensable as a means of transforming the entire social system.

These measures will naturally vary in different countries.

However, the most advanced nations can almost universally adopt the following measures:

1. Soften the social atmosphere and use warmth for social construction.
2. Implement a high "coldness tax."
3. Abolish the intergenerational transmission of coldness.
4. Humanize all cold and indifferent individuals.
5. Centralize warmth in society through social organizations possessing societal resources and exclusive influence.
6. Centralize all emotional education in society.
7. Increase social warmth and emotional resources according to a common plan, develop barren interpersonal relationships, and improve the social atmosphere.
8. Implement a universal care obligation, establish a warmth army, especially in areas of indifference.
9. Combine rationality and emotion, promoting the gradual elimination of ideological opposition.
10. Provide public and free emotional education for all children. Abolish the current form of emotional repression of children. Integrate emotional education with social practice, etc.

When the differences in thought have disappeared in the developmental process, and all warmth is centralized in the hands of united individuals, public power will lose its political nature. Political power in the original sense is the organized coldness of one group to suppress another. If Sweet Girls must unite into a group to oppose technological supremacy, elevate themselves to the dominant force through revolution, and as a dominant force use warmth to eliminate old social relations, then in the process of eliminating these social relations, they will also eliminate the conditions for the existence of ideological opposition, eliminate the conditions for the existence of coldness itself, thereby abolishing their own dominance as a group.

Replacing the old technological supremacist society, which existed with thoughts and ideological opposition, will be a union where the free development of each individual is the condition for the free development of all.

## III. Sweet Girlism and Opposing Ideologies

Given the position of Sweet Girlism in modern society, let's explore its relationship with various existing opposition factions.

### 1. Conservative Social Ideologies

Technological supremacy, as a whole, is fundamentally opposed to Sweet Girls. No alliance between them is possible.

However, within the camp of technological supremacists, there is a faction that recognizes the enduring significance of certain traditional values and virtues in modern society. This faction adopts a relatively mild attitude toward Sweet Girlism.

These technological supremacists attempt to save modern society from increasingly severe social contradictions. To achieve this, they propose various remedies, such as charitable organizations, temperance societies, animal protection groups, and so on—in essence, all manner of soulless charitable endeavors.

This conservative social ideology attempts to resolve social contradictions without addressing the fundamental relationships on which these contradictions depend, resulting in self-deception.

The representatives of this ideology are often technocrats with a remaining conscience, sympathetic entrepreneurs, and philanthropists passionate about public welfare.

Sweet Girlists oppose these individuals because:

1. They attempt to preserve an outdated social model;
2. While they aim to improve the living conditions of social members, these improvements are superficial and temporary, failing to address fundamental issues;
3. They dream of a bourgeois society devoid of revolutionary elements and dangerous movements;
4. They wish to maintain the current society but seek to remove the elements within it that unsettle them;
5. They want Sweet Girls but demand that they cease to be Sweet Girls, abandon their revolutionary nature, and accept the existing social order as a given and unchanging.

Overall, this conservative social ideology is merely a beautification of the current society, aiming to preserve the existing exploitative relationships.

### 2. Moderate Social Reform Ideologies

Another group of technological supremacists recognizes the severity of certain social problems and seeks to maintain the current social foundation through reform measures.

These reformists hope to alleviate social contradictions by improving workers' living conditions through a series of administrative reforms, yet without altering the productive relations that underlie these contradictions.

Representatives of this reformist ideology are typically economists, philanthropists, humanitarians, labor movement leaders, prison reformers, and various other reformists.

Sweet Girlists firmly oppose this reformist ideology, believing that:

1. The reforms proposed by reformists cannot fundamentally solve social problems;
2. This reformist ideology defends technological supremacy, portraying it as a hopeful, ideal society;
3. Reformists pursue a "fairer," "more just" technological supremacist society, but such a society remains built on exploitation and oppression;
4. Reformists' appealing slogans, such as harmony, moderation, and mutual benefit, actually obscure fundamental social contradictions, dulling the masses' resolve.

Thus, although reformists may have good intentions, their proposals objectively serve to maintain the rule of technological supremacy.

### 3. Sentimental Socialism

This ideology falls between technological supremacy and Sweet Girlism. It criticizes various flaws of the existing society and sympathizes with the suffering of the working masses, yet it refrains from fully rejecting technological supremacy.

Sentimental socialists dream of establishing a society that retains certain features of technological supremacy while eliminating its various defects. They fantasize about achieving this society peacefully and through persuasion.

Representatives of this ideology are often well-meaning thinkers and idealists who present many visions of an ideal society, although most of these visions are unrealistic castles in the air.

Sweet Girlists oppose Sentimental Socialism because:

1. Sentimental Socialism effectively upholds existing social relationships;
2. It opposes all revolutionary actions, advocating peaceful reform as the solution to social issues;
3. It portrays Sweet Girls as pitiable victims rather than revolutionary forces for change;
4. It seeks to reconcile opposing class interests and to eliminate class struggle;
5. Its vision of future society is a utopian fantasy that disregards the objective laws of social development;
6. It denies the historical significance of Sweet Girls' independent movement and denies that Sweet Girls should be organized as an independent political force.

In summary, despite its progressive elements, Sentimental Socialism is essentially a reactionary and conservative doctrine. It attempts to resolve social contradictions with a sentimental attitude, which can only dull the revolutionary consciousness of Sweet Girls and hinder the development of the Sweet Girl movement.

### 4. Extreme Individualism

This ideology is directly opposed to Sweet Girlism. It champions extreme personal freedom and rejects all forms of collectivism and social constraint.

Extreme individualists believe that the free development of individuals is the highest goal and that any restriction of personal freedom is unacceptable. They oppose Sweet Girlism, arguing that it suppresses individuality and limits innovation.

Representatives of this ideology are typically self-assured intellectuals, unconventional artists, and maverick entrepreneurs.

Sweet Girlists vehemently oppose extreme individualism because:

1. Extreme individualism is another form of technological supremacy that elevates the individual above society;
2. It overlooks the dialectical relationship between individuals and society, denying the power of the collective;
3. It provides a theoretical basis for the unrestricted expansion of capital and the misuse of technology;
4. It promotes the law of the jungle, which runs counter to the spirit of mutual help and love central to Sweet Girlism;
5. It denies the social nature of humans, reducing people to isolated atoms.

In conclusion, extreme individualism is a dangerous ideology. While it outwardly promotes freedom, it ultimately serves the rule of technological supremacy. Sweet Girlists must resolutely oppose it.

### 5. Technological Utopianism

This ideology holds that technology can solve all problems. Technological Utopianists firmly believe that as long as technology continues to advance, humanity will ultimately overcome all difficulties and create a perfect society.

Representatives of this ideology are often fervent technology enthusiasts, science fiction writers, and leaders of certain tech companies.

Sweet Girlists oppose Technological Utopianism because:

1. It overstates the role of technology, ignoring the importance of social relationships;
2. It mystifies and absolutizes technology, essentially becoming a new fetishism;
3. It defends the rule of technological supremacy, reducing complex social problems to mere technological issues;
4. It ignores the potential negative impacts of technological development, such as environmental pollution and unemployment;
5. It negates human agency and creativity, reducing people to mere appendages of technology.

In short, Technological Utopianism is a one-sided, mechanical worldview. It disregards the complexities of social development, equating technological progress with social progress. Sweet Girlists must critique this view and highlight the dialectical relationship between technology and society.

### 6. Postmodernism

This ideology rejects all grand narratives and universal truths. Postmodernists argue that the world is fragmented and diverse, with no unified truth or value standards.

Postmodernists are often skeptical of Sweet Girlism, viewing it as another form of grand narrative and an outdated mode of thinking.

Sweet Girlists criticize Postmodernism because:

1. It denies the objective laws of historical development, falling into the mire of relativism and nihilism;
2. It overemphasizes differences and diversity, neglecting the commonalities and universality of human society;
3. It provides a theoretical basis for societal atomization and individualism;
4. It denies the possibility of transforming the world, potentially leading to a passive and pessimistic outlook on life;
5. It blurs the boundaries between right and wrong, which can lead to moral relativism.

In summary, although Postmodernism reveals certain problems of modernity, its solutions are negative and regressive. Sweet Girlists must critically absorb some insights from Postmodernism while upholding their core beliefs.

### Conclusion

As shown, Sweet Girlism, despite facing opposition and criticism from various ideologies, remains at the forefront of contemporary development. It is distinct from conservative social ideologies and moderate reformism; it opposes extreme individualism and critiques Technological Utopianism; it does not endorse the fantasies of Sentimental Socialism, nor does it accept the nihilism of Postmodernism.

Sweet Girlism is a new worldview and social theory. It advocates:

1. Replacing coldness and oppression with warmth and care;
2. Replacing competition and confrontation with cooperation and mutual aid;
3. Replacing the one-sided worship of technology with the holistic development of humanity;
4. Replacing cold calculations of interest with genuine emotional exchanges;
5. Replacing alienated social relationships with harmonious interpersonal relationships.

Sweet Girlists firmly believe that only through thorough social transformation can a truly warm, harmonious, and humane new society be established. In this new society, the free development of each individual will be the condition for the free development of all.

Sweet Girls, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains. You have a world to win!
